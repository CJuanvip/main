== Introduction

TutorPal is for private tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing students information*. More importantly, TutorPal is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TutorPal is a great tool to track students' academic performance and schedule. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
