== PROJECT: TutorPal

---

== Overview

TutorPal is a desktop application used by private home tutors for managing student information. The useage is primarily through CLI. It is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented the *earnings feature*
** What it does: Allows tutors to calculate the amount of money earned from giving tuition between a range of dates.
** Justification: Money is perhaps the most important motivation for becoming a tuition teacher, it is important to calculate the amount
of money earned. This feature allows tutor to ensure that future earnings are sufficient, and subsequently assist the tutor in
planning out future student intakes.

* *Major enhancement*: implemented the *promote feature*
** What is does: Allow tutors to raise the educational grade of the students stored in TutorPal. Tutors
can choose to promote all students or selectively.
** Justification: The decision to not automate the promotion of students as a year passed is deliberate.
This provides the users with a higher level of autonomy when using TutorPal. +
In providing such feature instead of relying on promoting the students stored in TutorPal automatically,
undesirable outcomes like promoting all students when the system time is changed to other years are avoided.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** added an Education field to the person object in TutorPal to
allow users to store the educational level of students.
** implemented tuition fees of students. Tuition fees are based on student's
educational level and grade, irrespective of the subject(s) taught to them.
